# Image Scoring MCP Server

The `image-scoring` MCP server provides direct access to the Firebird database and scoring engine status. It is defined in the MCP config but **disabled by default** — enable it when you need database debugging that goes beyond the Electron app's built-in queries.

## MCP Config

In `mcp_config.json`, the server is configured as:

```json
"image-scoring": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["-m", "modules.mcp_server"],
    "cwd": "d:\\Projects\\image-scoring",
    "env": { "PYTHONPATH": "d:\\Projects\\image-scoring" },
    "disabled": true
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> When this server is disabled, its tools are unavailable. Ask the user to enable it before attempting to use these tools.

## Available Tools

### Diagnostic Tools

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `get_error_summary` | Overview of job failures and missing scores | Investigating why images have no scores |
| `check_database_health` | Integrity check for Firebird records | Verifying DB consistency after bulk operations |
| `get_model_status` | GPU and model status | Understanding why scoring may be slow or failing |

### Data Query Tools

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `query_images` | Advanced filtering by scores, ratings, labels | Debugging filter issues in the gallery |
| `get_image_details` | Full record for a specific file path | Verifying a specific image's data |
| `execute_sql` | Direct SELECT queries | Complex analysis not covered by other tools |

## Common Workflows

### 1. Investigate Missing Scores
```
1. get_error_summary          → See which models failed
2. get_model_status           → Check if GPU/models are available
3. query_images (with filters) → Verify which images are affected
```

### 2. Verify Score Values
```
1. get_image_details (by path) → See raw model output values
2. execute_sql                  → Compare against expected normalization
```

### 3. Database Health Check
```
1. check_database_health       → Look for orphaned records, NULL scores
2. execute_sql                  → Run targeted queries if issues found
```

### 4. Debug Gallery Filtering
When the gallery shows unexpected results:
```
1. query_images (same filters as gallery) → Compare DB results with UI
2. get_image_details (specific image)     → Verify individual record values
3. execute_sql (raw query)                → Check the exact SQL the app would generate
```
